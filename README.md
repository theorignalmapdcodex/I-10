# DTK530_I_7_MiniProj_MichaelA_P

## Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is part of a mini-project for the DTK530_I_7 course. It includes data analysis and visualization tasks, potentially involving machine learning. The project uses a variety of Python libraries for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and plotting.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, the following Python packages need to be installed:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and array handling
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib`: For basic data visualization
- `seaborn`: For advanced statistical data visualization
- `sklearn (scikit-learn)`: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- `scipy`: For scientific and statistical functions
- `plotly`: For interactive and web-based data visualizations
- `ipywidgets`: For creating interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks
- `notebook`: For running and working with Jupyter notebooks
- `statsmodels`: For statistical modeling and econometrics
- `tabulate`: For creating nicely formatted tables in various output formats

You can install all requirements using:

`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy plotly ipywidgets notebook statsmodels tabulate`
